# Techologies used
The tic tac toe app functions as a single page application using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap and Sass. It also uses Javascript, jQuery, an API with AJAX calls.

# Development Story
- I started this process with html and css so I could start the game logic.
- Once the logic was flushed out, I leveraged both JavaScript and jQuery to build the app. Then I tackled AJAX.
- I successfully (after many... many hours) connected the Tic Tac Toe API to allow the user to register, log in, change password once logged in, create a new game, and mark game board cell, and return number of games the user played.

# Unsolved problems that will be fixed in next release
- Design - would like to add to the design in the future.
- Once a message is displayed wheter error or not the message stays throughout the users experience until the screen is refreshed.

# Wireframes and User Stories

# User Stories
- User needs to be able to register an account and login. Then, the user needs to be able to create a game and enter either an X on the board (new games always start with X).
- The game needs to alert user to any login or sign up issues.
- As a user, I can play against another player on the same computer (we can take turns).
- The game needs to be able to change player turns.
- The game needs to tell user if X won, O won, or if tie game.
- The game needs a scoring system to track wins
- The games needs to have a button to play a new game and clear the board when game is over
